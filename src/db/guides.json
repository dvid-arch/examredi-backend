    "content": "\n# Cellular Respiration: An Overview\n\nCellular respiration is the process by which organisms combine oxygen with foodstuff molecules, diverting the chemical energy in these substances into life-sustaining activities and discarding, as waste products, carbon dioxide and water.\n\n## Key Stages:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis:**\n    *   Occurs in the cytoplasm.\n    *   Breaks down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate.\n    *   Net production of 2 ATP and 2 NADH.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Oxidation:**\n    *   Takes place in the mitochondrial matrix.\n    *   Converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA.\n    *   Produces CO2 and NADH.\n\n3.  **The Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):**\n    *   Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.\n    *   Completes the breakdown of glucose.\n    *   Generates ATP, NADH, and FADH2.\n    *   Releases CO2.\n\n4.  **Oxidative Phosphorylation:**\n    *   Involves the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis.\n    *   Occurs on the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n    *   NADH and FADH2 donate electrons to the chain, powering ATP synthesis.\n    *   Oxygen is the final electron acceptor, forming water.\n    *   Produces the majority of ATP (around 32-34 molecules).\n    "

    "content": "\n# Newton's Laws of Motion\n\nThese three laws describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces.\n\n## The Three Laws:\n\n1.  **First Law (Law of Inertia):**\n    *   An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\n    *   Inertia is the resistance to a change in motion.\n\n2.  **Second Law (Law of Acceleration):**\n    *   The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.\n    *   Formula: **$F = ma$** (Force = mass × acceleration)\n\n3.  **Third Law (Law of Action-Reaction):**\n    *   For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n    *   This means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object equals the size of the force on the second object.\n    "
